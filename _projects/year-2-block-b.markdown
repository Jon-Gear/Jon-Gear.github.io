## üèîÔ∏è Terrain Editor ‚Äì My Contributions

### üîç What It Does

The **Custom C++ Terrain Editor** is a solo-developed terrain sculpting tool and rendering system built in C++ using OpenGL. It enables real-time terrain editing via an intuitive brush interface, allowing users to raise/lower terrain, flatten areas, smooth contours, and scatter foliage‚Äîall with visual feedback. It also includes dynamic heightmap-based terrain rendering and an interactive camera system for navigation.

This project served as the **predecessor to the Terrain Editor in Fire Ant**, laying the groundwork for compute-driven tools and brush architecture used in later engine projects.

## üî® My Contributions

### üåÑ Terrain Rendering

![image1](../../assets/images/Y2B/terrain_rendering.png)

I built a full rendering pipeline for **heightmap-displaced terrain** using a custom vertex shader that dynamically adjusts vertex positions based on height texture values.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time terrain displacement using heightmap textures.
* Per-pixel normal calculation in vertex shader using height differentials.
* Visual terrain sculpting directly reflected in mesh deformation.

**Challenges:**

* Implementing dynamic normals in shader for accurate lighting.
* Encoding and decoding 32-bit float height values in RGBA textures.
* Integrating seamlessly into the existing BEE rendering system.

### üñåÔ∏è Brush System

I developed a fully functional **brush-based editing interface** that modifies terrain heightmap data in real time. Each brush operates on a targeted region and modifies texture data on the CPU before uploading it back to the GPU.

#### üß± Raise and Lower Brush

![image1](../../assets/images/Y2B/brush_lower.gif)


**What It Does:**
Raises or lowers terrain in a circular region using a Gaussian distribution, with optional "average terrain" filtering to sculpt only selected elevations.

**Key Features:**

* Brush size controlled via GUI and keyboard shortcuts (`[` and `]`).
* Gaussian falloff for natural hills and valleys.
* Optional averaging mode for smoother sculpting.

**Challenges:**

* Precision sampling and modification of texture regions.
* Efficient GPU upload via `glTexSubImage2D`.
* Integrating user-defined intensity, radius, and direction.

#### üèîÔ∏è Plateau Brush

![image1](../../assets/images/Y2B/brush_plateau.gif)

**What It Does:**
Flattens terrain within the brush area to a target height‚Äîeither manually set or sampled from the terrain via mouse click.

**Key Features:**

* Terrain sampling for real-time height targeting.
* Sharp yet smooth edges using distance-based Gaussian blending.
* Adjustable brush shape and diameter.

**Challenges:**

* Real-time sampling and synchronization between UI and edit operations.
* Balancing falloff and accuracy to prevent unnatural flat zones.

#### üß© Smoothing Brush

**What It Does:**
Averages surrounding terrain to eliminate sharp edges and create smooth transitions between sculpted features.

**Key Features:**

* Computes average height of brush region and nudges local points toward it.
* Effective for softening harsh elevation changes.

**Challenges:**

* Preventing over-smoothing and maintaining natural detail.
* Efficient height sampling and buffer handling.

#### üå≥ Foliage Brush

![image1](../../assets/images/Y2B/brush_foliage.gif)


**What It Does:**
Spawns props (like trees) along terrain, with random scattering and optional alignment to terrain normals.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time prop spawning based on brush area.
* Placement along surface normals using dynamic heightmap-based normal calculation.
* Supports arbitrary models (trees, rocks, etc.).

**Challenges:**

* Calculating normals in CPU-space based on sampled height differences.
* Aligning rotation to match surface orientation (quaternion math).
* Managing object instancing and entity creation.

---

### üïπÔ∏è Camera System

I implemented a free-fly 3D camera system with full keyboard and mouse support to allow intuitive navigation across the terrain.

**Key Features:**

* WASD + QE movement controls with Shift-based speed boost.
* Mouse-based pitch and yaw using quaternion math.
* Camera frustum integration for viewport interaction.

**Challenges:**

* Handling mouse sensitivity and orientation smoothly across all axes.
* Ensuring intuitive controls within an ImGui-driven editor.

---

### üß† Key Engineering Techniques

* **Raycasting** from screen to world space for accurate brush placement.
* **UV coordinate derivation** from 3D brush position to texture space.
* **Brush zone sampling & editing** using bounding box logic on heightmaps.
* **Efficient GPU I/O** via partial `glTexSubImage2D` updates.
* **Gaussian weight distribution** for natural deformation.
* **Normal vector reconstruction** from sampled height gradients.

### üéØ Summary of Impact

This project taught me the fundamentals of shader-based terrain deformation, interactive editor systems, and real-time tool development. It directly led to major architectural improvements in later projects like the Terrain Editor in Fire Ant.

My brush system, heightmap-based editing, and real-time feedback loop laid a reusable foundation for more scalable GPU-powered editing tools.
